# Welcome to the OpenCon 2017 Charlottesville Do-a-thon, which is also the first DSI Do-a-thon
              
Doathons bring together diverse participants to get things done &mdash; openly, collaboratively and quickly. The event centers around participants (no monologues!) and focused attention to doable projects, where collaboration, discovery and preservation are made easy. 

The term is inspired by hackathons &mdash; events focused on coding &mdash; but the activities can and do extend well beyond coding, e.g. to include graphic design storytelling, policy or curriculum development, outreach activities, you name it.

To get an idea of what this might mean in practice, take a look at a [previous doathon](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon) and [see what was done there](https://github.com/sparcopen/Open-Research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).

# Who?

The event is for people interested in open data &mdash; providers, aggregators or users of open data, data visualizers, data journalists, user experience designers, educators or anyone working towards making data open or reusing open data.

It is organized by the [Data Science Institute](http://dsi.virginia.edu/) (DSI) at the University of Virginia as a satellite event to the [OpenCon doathon](http://doathon.opencon2017.org/) held on 13 November 2017 in Berlin, which was part of [OpenCon 2017](http://opencon2017.org/) and gave rise to a [range of issues](https://github.com/sparcopen/doathon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) that are still being worked on.

# When?

18-19 November 2017 (Saturday & Sunday; 9am-4:30pm on both days)

If things go well this time, check out [what's next](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/2017-doathon/blob/master/README.md#whats-next).

# Where?

At [OpenGrounds](https://opengrounds.virginia.edu/) (in [The Corner](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=20/38.03405/-78.49981)), 1400 University Ave, Charlottesville, VA 22903.

# What?

The theme of this event will be [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data), i.e. data that have been shared with no or minimal restrictions on reuse. 

On day 1, the focus will be more on open research data, on day 2 on open data from the city of Charlottesville, Albemarle county and the state of Virginia. For details, go to [data.md](data.md).

# How?

We are collecting ideas in this repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/2017-doathon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aidea). Please check whether any of the projects in there are of interest to you already, or consider adding your own by opening a new issue. You will be able to submit new ideas until and throughout the event.

The ideas listed there will form the basis of the idea pitches, by which we try to match people with ideas. [Here](https://twitter.com/OKFN/status/838011416598700033) is an example of a pitch that was made at an earlier doathon, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMR7N193uM8) is an example of a remote pitch for the same event. Once the groups are formed, they start working on the ideas they chose, at their own pace but with the option to ask around the room (or the Web) for help if they get stuck, and to have lunch on site.

About 2-3 times during the day, work will be briefly interrupted to document what has been done. See how this looked at [prior](https://github.com/sparcopen/doathon/issues) [events](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues). The goal here is to make visible progress, not necessarily to deliver a polished final product. We plan to organize more of those doathons in Charlottesville in the future, and since we are working in the open, we can continue work others have started, or vice versa.

# How to prepare

* [Let us know you're coming](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/uva-do-a-thon-tickets-39704865321). (Done)
* [Let us know you're actually around](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/2017-doathon/issues/40).
* Start typing some basic info about you [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13IJTpte7IdbCjkNMcVPy5KMP8eKiYAcSVXQzNbfwu_M/edit).
* Think about what you can contribute to or what you would like to learn at the event. For instance, 
  - if you are providers of open data, let us know about what people are doing with the data or what ideas you have on what could be done with the data
  - if you have data but it's not open yet, consider making (some of) it open, or learning what this would entail
  - if you are looking for open data on a specific matter, let us know, and we can explore together where such data might be available and whether and how it could be made open in a way that suits your use case
* Review the [ideas already posted](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/2017-doathon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aidea) or [post yours](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/2017-doathon/issues/new).

# What's next?

We are seeing this doathon as a prototype for a series of similar events to be held in or around Charlottesville on a variety of topics, and to follow up on projects from previous ones. If you are interested in helping organize a future one, please get in touch.
